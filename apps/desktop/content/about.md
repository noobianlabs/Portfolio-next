I'm Abdullah Saleh, a Developer Advocate and Software Engineer based in Brooklyn, NY.

Thanks for taking the time to explore my portfolio. If you have any questions or comments, please contact me via the contact application or shoot me an email at noobianlabs@gmail.com

## About me

As a computer science professional with experience in machine learning and community organizing, I have developed strong problem-solving and communication skills, along with a deep understanding of the social and ethical implications of emerging technologies.

My passion for machine learning, coupled with my commitment to community building, makes me a strong candidate for roles focused on advancing machine learning technology. I am eager to contribute to the growth and development of machine learning libraries and communities.

## Education

I graduated from Brooklyn College, City University of New York with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in June 2023.

## Career Journey

My career began with a Data Science internship at IBM in Brooklyn, where I prototyped an automated Repair-or-Replace decision system for the Maximo Enterprise Asset Management. Following this, I served as a Data Science Apprentice at IBM, where I assisted in research for Science for Social Good.

From 2023 to 2024, I worked as a Software Engineer at CVS Health, participating in a rotational program across back-end (Spring Boot) and front-end (Stencil, Next.js) teams. I also assisted with AI/ML prototypes leveraging Ollama, Llama Index, Hugging Face, and Gradio.

Currently, I serve as a Developer Advocate at Habibi Tech, where I develop and deliver engaging demos on using LLMs and building RAG systems.

## Community Work

Beyond my technical work, I'm deeply committed to community organizing. I served as Vice President of We Are STEM from 2019 to 2021. From 2021 to 2024, I served as Chairperson of For Our Liberation, leading mutual aid projects in Brooklyn.

Currently, I'm involved with the Sudanese Resistance Front, Awlad Al Neel, and People > Profit, working on political advocacy and community-led tech initiatives.
